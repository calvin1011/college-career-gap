              <p>
                My name is Calvin, an Adams State senior. I&#39;ve attended Adams State, and during my college years I&#39;ve
                experienced barriers as a student going to a small school and going out to grind to look for opportunities.
                Not everyone has this drive, and sometimes life happens. So I figured if students had a resource hub, not LinkedIn
                where you&#39;re slammed with a bunch of random things, not Handshake that&#39;s not bridging the college-career gap, a
                resource that actually focuses on student success: College Career Gap.
              </p>
              <p>
                Built by a student for students and professors. Bridging the gap from your freshman year until you graduate.
                There&#39;s a lot of info I&#39;ve learned in my junior and senior year because that&#39;s when I thought I should start grinding
                for my career. That&#39;s not true, because if I learned a lot of these things in  my first or second year, maybe I would&#39;ve
                had a better vision, even better if my professors had shared a lot of helpful resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students join specific channels targeted to their career goals. The platform creates a seamless experience for students
                and professors. I hope this can make a change and help bridge the career gap beyond just going to class and doing assignments
                and stopping at that.
